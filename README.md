My Recipe Book
Overview
My Recipe Book is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create, store, and view recipes. Users can add recipes with an image, name, ingredients, and preparation process, which are saved locally in the browser using localStorage. The app displays recipes in a gallery format and shows detailed views when a recipe is selected.
Files

index.html: The main HTML file that structures the application, including the title, add recipe button, gallery, details section, and a modal form for adding recipes.
script.js: Handles the application logic, including form display, recipe saving, gallery rendering, and displaying recipe details.
style.css: Provides styling for the app, including a responsive grid layout for the gallery, modal form design, and hover effects for interactivity.

Features

Add Recipes: Users can input a recipe name, ingredients, process, and upload an image via a modal form.
Local Storage: Recipes are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence across sessions.
Recipe Gallery: Displays recipe images in a responsive grid, with each image clickable to view details.
Recipe Details: Shows the selected recipe's name, ingredients, and process in a formatted view.
Responsive Design: The app is styled for a consistent experience across different screen sizes.
Interactive UI: Includes hover effects, a modal form, and clear visual feedback for user actions.
